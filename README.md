# Video Game Sales Forecasting
This is an academic project that aims to forecast the sales of video games using machine learning.

## Data
The data for this project was collected by scraping the website SteamDB. It includes information about the sales of video games for different platforms...

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before applying machine learning techniques, we performed some exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data to understand its characteristics and identify any patterns or trends.

## Machine Learning
To forecast the sales of video games, we used the fbprophet library to fit a time series model to the data. The model was trained on the sales data and used to make predictions for future sales.

## Conclusion
This project was solely for academic purposes, and it demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for sales forecasting, and the fbprophet library is a powerful tool for this purpose.

### Usage
To run the code in this project, you will need to install the following libraries:
  pandas
  numpy
  seaborn
  matplotlib
  plotly
  selenium
  bs4
  undectected_chromedriver
  pmdarima
  prophet
  seaborn

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the code in the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.
